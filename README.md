# Ruby Hangman Game Project

Hangman is normally a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses. (WikiPedia)
And this project simulates the game in a Ruby project.
