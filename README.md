# Ruby Hangman Game Project

Hangman is normally a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses. (Wikipedia)

And this project implements the Hangman game into a basic command-line game using Ruby language.
